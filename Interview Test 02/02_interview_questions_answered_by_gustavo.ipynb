    "## Question 2) Give an example of a linear vector space (with a basis).\n",
    "By definition, a vector space is a non-empty set $V$, with two operations: sum and multiplication by scalars. By definition, a vector space has to satisfy a set of properties (axioms). An example of a vector space is the set of vectors $V$ given by $R^2$ where $R^2$ is given by the set $(x_1 , x_2)$ where $x_i$ belongs to the set of real numbers. This is also known as the plane vector space since it can be used to represent any point (which is represented by a pair of real numbers) on a plane as a vector, which begins at the origin and ends at the point.

The algorithm uses a top-down greedy search approach to form splits that maximize information gain for the categorical targets. \n",

Elementary row operations (permutation, multiplication and addition) are used iteratively to transform the matrix of coefficients into an identity matrix. If the determinant of the matrix is non-zero, an identity matrix can be obtained. For each row, a pivot is chosen. Operations are chosen for the rows below in a way so that the values under the pivot become zero. The row of the pivot can also be divided by the pivot to obtain the pivot as the value $1$. By the end, the result will be an upper triangular matrix with a main diagonal of ones.  Elementary row operations can then be done so that the values above the pivots (starting from the bottom row) also becomes zero. This operation is repeated until an identity matrix is obtained. We have just described the process of transforming a normal matrix into the identity matrix. \n",

Visualizing the distribution of data using packages like ggplot and matplotlib can help the analyst to really understand the data. This is a very good solution for categorical data. A more in-depth analysis can also be done via statistical analysis of the attributes. \n",
